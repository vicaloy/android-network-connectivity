# Network Connectivity Feature - Android App

This Android app feature is designed to check the network connectivity status and provide real-time information to the user. The app will display the current network connection status (e.g., connected, disconnected) and additional information such as connection speed (download/upload speeds) when an active internet connection is available.

## Description

The task involves implementing a network connectivity feature that checks the availability of an internet connection on the device, displays the network status, and retrieves additional information like the connection speed when applicable. The app should handle scenarios where the device is disconnected or if speed information cannot be retrieved.
